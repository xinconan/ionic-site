Modes allow you to configure an app's interaction and behavior. Like platform continuity in V1, V2's modes go a step further by allowing for completely different experience based on the current platform.
Modes can be configured at several levels, app wide, platform specific, or component specific.

### App Wide

Say you wanted to have material design enable for both Android and iOS. To do this, you use the `config` object on your `@App` annotation.

```typescript
import {App, Config} from 'ionic/ionic'

@App({
  template: '<ion-nav [root]="rootPage"></ion-nav>',
  config: {
    mode: 'md'
  }
})
```
This will enable material design mode for both iOS and android.

### Platform Level Configurations

While app-wide mode change are easy, you may wanted to only change a few properties. To do this, you could pass the mode you want to target and configure it that way

```typescript
import {App, Config} from 'ionic/ionic'
@App({
  template: '<ion-nav [root]="rootPage"></ion-nav>',
  config: {
    platforms: {
      ios: {
        iconMode: 'md',
        menuType: 'overlay',
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Now on iOS, we'll only set the icon mode and menu reveal for material design.
You could also remove the platform/ios object and just keep `iconMode` and `menuType` to set these across platforms

### Component Level Configurations

You could also configure certain properties based on the markup you use.

```typescript
import {App, Config} from 'ionic/ionic'
@App({
  template: '<ion-nav [root]="rootPage"></ion-nav>',
  config: {
    tabsPlacement: 'bottom'
  }
})
```

But in our tabs markup, we can override that

```html
<ion-tabs tabbar-placement="top">
  ---
</ion-tabs>
```

The markup level config will take precedent over the original config object.
