Navigation is how users move between different pages in your app. Ionic's navigation follows standard native navigation concepts, like [those in iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewControllerCatalog/Chapters/NavigationControllers.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011313-CH2-SW1). In order to enable native-like navigation, we've built a few new navigation components that might feel different for developers used to traditional desktop browser navigation.

<!--
Like native apps, URLs are not required for navigation in Ionic.  Instead, pages are pushed and popped on and off a navigation controller's page stack.  URLs can be used to link back to unique, important parts of your app ("deeplinking") but don't define navigation as your app runs.
-->

There are several ways to navigate throughout an Ionic app:

<a target="_blank" class="component-doc-demo" href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-preview-app/tree/master/src/pages/navigation/basic">
  Demo Source
</a>

Navigation is handled through the [`<ion-nav>`](../api/components/nav/Nav/) component, which works as a simple stack that new pages are pushed onto and popped off of, corresponding to moving forward and backward in history.

We start with a root page that loads the Nav component:

```typescript
import {StartPage} from 'start'

@Component({
  template: '<ion-nav [root]="rootPage"></ion-nav>'
})
class MyApp {
  // First page to push onto the stack
  rootPage = StartPage;
}
```

Next, we can access the Navigation Controller in each page that is navigated to by injecting it into any of our Pages.
Note that Page components does not need a selector. Ionic adds these automatically .

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
  <ion-header>
    <ion-navbar>
      <ion-title>Login</ion-title>
    </ion-navbar>
  </ion-header>

  <ion-content>Hello World</ion-content>`
})
export class StartPage {
  constructor(public navCtrl: NavController) {
  }
}
```

To navigate from one page to another simply push or pop a new page onto the stack:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
  <ion-header>
    <ion-navbar>
      <ion-title>Login</ion-title>
    </ion-navbar>
  </ion-header>

  <ion-content>
    <button (click)="goToOtherPage()">
      Go to OtherPage
    </button>
  </ion-content>`
})
export class StartPage {
  constructor(public navCtrl: NavController) {}

  goToOtherPage() {
    //push another page onto the history stack
    //causing the nav controller to animate the new page in
    this.navCtrl.push(OtherPage);
  }
}

@Component({
  template: `
  <ion-header>
    <ion-navbar>
      <ion-title>Other Page</ion-title>
    </ion-navbar>
  </ion-header>

  <ion-content>I'm the other page!</ion-content>`
})
class OtherPage {}
```

If your page has an [`<ion-navbar>`](../api/components/navbar/NavBar/), a back button will automatically be added to it if it is not a root page, and the title of the Nav Bar will be updated.

Alternatively, if you want to go back, but don't have a NavBar, you can pop the current page off the stack:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
  <ion-content>
    <button (click)="goBack()">
      There's no place like home
    </button>
  </ion-content>`
})
class OtherPage {
  constructor(public navCtrl: NavController) {}

  goBack() {
    this.navCtrl.pop();
  }
}
```

<h3 id="navigating_routing">Routing and DeepLinking</h3>

Pushing and popping views is a simple operation that can be made more powerful with URLs for routing and deeplinking. We can identify pages with a URL we share to users that brings them back to the exact page they were viewing when they left (including setting the history state if we desire), and we can have our Nav Controller navigate to pages based on a URL segment.

To enable linking directly to a page, we use the `@DeepLink` decorator, specifying a unique identifier for the page (the 'name') and a page segment that goes into the URL that maps to this page. This means we can have a long URL specifying a specific history state *or* a short one, but return to the app with this page at the top of the history stack:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
  <ion-header>
    <ion-navbar>
      <ion-title>Login</ion-title>
    </ion-navbar>
  </ion-header>

  <ion-content>
  </ion-content>`
})
@DeepLink({
  name: 'login', // Unique identifer (no spaces) of this page for easy routing
  segment: 'user/login' // (optional) Segment in the URL that links to this page. Defaults to the name
})
export class LoginPage {
  constructor(public navCtrl: NavController) {}
}
```
-->



<h3 id="navigating_from_root">Navigating from the Root Component</h3>
What if you want to control navigation from your root app component? You can't inject `NavController` because any components that are navigation controllers are _children_ of the root component so they aren't available to be injected.

By adding a reference variable to the `ion-nav`, you can use `@ViewChild` to get an instance of the `Nav` component, which is a navigation controller (it extends `NavController`):

```typescript
@Component({
  template: '<ion-nav #myNav [root]="rootPage"></ion-nav>'
})
export class MyApp {
  @ViewChild('myNav') nav
  rootPage = TabsPage;

  // Wait for the components in MyApp's template to be initialized
  // In this case, we are waiting for the Nav identified by
  // the template reference variable #myNav
  ngAfterViewInit() {
    // Let's navigate from TabsPage to Page1
    this.nav.push(LoginPage);
  }
}
```


<h3 id="advanced_navigation">Tabbed Navigation</h3>

Navigation can be nested and used inside of complex components like Tabs. Unlike traditional routing systems, Ionic's navigation makes it easy to navigate to a given Page from anywhere in the app without specifying a specific route to it. To use the App Store app on iOS as an example, we can easily navigate to the AppDetailPage that shows info about a specific app from any tab (try it yourself to see!). Take a look at the [Tabs](#tabs) docs for more info on how to easily achieve this.
