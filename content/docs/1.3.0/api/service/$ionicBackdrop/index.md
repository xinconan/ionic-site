$ionicBackdrop



</h1>





Shows and hides a backdrop over the UI.  Appears behind popups, loading,
and other overlays.

Often, multiple UI components require a backdrop, but only one backdrop is
ever needed in the DOM at a time.

Therefore, each component that requires the backdrop to be shown calls
`$ionicBackdrop.retain()` when it wants the backdrop, then `$ionicBackdrop.release()`
when it is done with the backdrop.

For each time `retain` is called, the backdrop will be shown until `release` is called.

For example, if `retain` is called three times, the backdrop will be shown until `release`
is called three times.

**Notes:**
- The backdrop service will broadcast 'backdrop.shown' and 'backdrop.hidden' events from the root scope,
this is useful for alerting native components not in html.









## Usage
```js
function MyController($scope, $ionicBackdrop, $timeout, $rootScope) {
  //Show a backdrop for one second
  $scope.action = function() {
    $ionicBackdrop.retain();
    $timeout(function() {
      $ionicBackdrop.release();
    }, 1000);
  };

  // Execute action on backdrop disappearing
  $scope.$on('backdrop.hidden', function() {
    // Execute action
  });

  // Execute action on backdrop appearing
  $scope.$on('backdrop.shown', function() {
    // Execute action
  });

}
```
