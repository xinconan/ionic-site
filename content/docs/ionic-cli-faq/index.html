<!-- Platform ready -->
<h3 class="title">Common Issues and FAQs</h3>

<section class="docs-section active" id="platform-ready">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#platform-ready">Platform.ready</a></h3>
  <p>
    Before using native Cordova plugins, apps need to listen for the platform ready event. The best way to do this is in
    the <code>run</code> function of your app:
  </p>
  {% highlight javascript %}
  myModule.run(function($ionicPlatform) {
    $ionicPlatform.ready(function() {
      // Anything native should go here, like StatusBar.styleLightContent()
    });
  });
  {% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    Sometimes, this event never fires and that case can be difficult to debug. Generally, when <code>$ionicPlatform.ready</code> does not
    fire, or the lower-level <code>deviceready</code> event does not fire from Cordova, it means your plugins are in
    an inconsistent state.
  </p>
  <p>
    To remedy this, remove your existing plugins and reinstall them. For each plugin, run:
  </p>
  {% highlight bash %}
  cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-statusbar
  cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-statusbar
  {% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    If this does not resolve the issue, please let us know if you might be using a cordova plugin that is faulty: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/163L7WP7Q8q6cSgJyfFn2RKUu0iyy3jlYqf94VvyKvNI/viewform?usp=send_form">Report Bad Cordova Plugin</a>

  <p>
    Are you using a Cordova plugin that is either unstable (crashes, doens't function properly), or outdated (breaks on new mobile OS's, etc.)?
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us know by reporting it on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/163L7WP7Q8q6cSgJyfFn2RKUu0iyy3jlYqf94VvyKvNI/viewform?usp=send_form">Bad Cordova Plugin</a> form.

<section class="docs-section active" id="touch-events">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#tap-issues">Ionic breaks touch/mouse events for 3rd party library</a></h3>

  <p>
    Running into an issue where Ionic's tap and event handling system is conflicting with a 3rd party library,
    such as a map widget or embedded object?
  </p>
  <p>
    Ionic's complex event system makes it possible to build mobile apps in the browser with fast and fluid
    touch events and gestures. Unfortunately, that can conflict with widgets that expect to have full control
    over their own events.
  </p>
  <p>
    To fix this, add <code>data-tap-disabled="true"</code> around the widget. For example:
  </p>
  {% highlight html %}
  <div id="google_map" data-tap-disabled="true"></div>
  {% endhighlight %}

<!-- Android SDK
  ================================================== -->

<h3 class="title">Ionic CLI</h3>

<p>When working with Cordova and Ionic, Node is to be your best friend. Specifically, working with Node and the Command Line. Yet getting things set up often seems to be a challenge, especially when it comes to setting up things cross platform (Mac,
  Windows, Linux).</p>
<p>Below are a few issues that are not necessarily an Ionic Framework issue, but common pitfalls seen related to Cordova, Node, NPM, Android:</p>

<section class="docs-section active" id="android-sdk">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#android-sdk">Android SDK</a></h3>
  <p>Setting up the Android SDK is a complicated process for Windows and Linux.</p>
  <p>Recently, Ubuntu has gotten an awesome tool called Ubuntu Developer Tools Center and with it you can install the Android SDK and Android Studio. I’m not going to go over the details, but you can check out this <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2014/09/canonical-releases-ubuntu-developer.html">blog post</a> and
    see the steps.</p>
  <p>The setup process for Android on Windows has been covered in depth on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNrNIHQ9cWo">our YouTube tutorial.</a>
    The only thing I can add is to include installing git during your setup.</p>
  <p>Macs tend to have the least problems when setting up an Android environment. There a few ways to handle it and this is just one of them. The end goal is to have the SDK installed, install Java, install Ant.</p>
  <p>Install Java - This can be by going to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572">this page.</a>
    Install Ant - The quickest way to install Apache Ant is with Homebrew.</p>

  {% highlight bash %} $ brew install ant {% endhighlight %}



  <p>Install the SDK - This can be done a few different ways. The one I like to use is by installing <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a>. This will let you install an editor that comes bundled with the Android SDK. So now our SDK is in our Applications Folder.</p>
  <p>Edit .bash_profile - So if you’ve followed the steps above, you’ll need to edit your .bash_profile to include the following. If you didn’t install Android Studio, then no problem. You’ll just need to change the path to the SDK. You want to include the SDK tools and SDK Platform-tools.</p>
  {% highlight bash %} vim ~/.bash_profile {% endhighlight %}
  <p>Add this:</p>
  {% highlight bash %}
export PATH=${PATH}:/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/sdk/platform-tools:/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/sdk/tools
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>With that, enter <code>source ~/.bash_profile</code> to update everything.</p>

<!-- Genymotion
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="genymotion">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#genymotion">Faster Android Emulation</a></h3>
        <p>Having trouble emulating your Android apps? The Android emulator is notoriously slow, but there are some new choices available for speeding it up.</p>
        <p>
          First, follow the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html">Android Emulator</a> docs to ensure you're tried an image with Intel virtualization extensions added.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that doesn't work, <a href="http://www.genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a> is a great replacement. It uses a virtual machine to emulate android devices and does it nearly perfectly. One thing to remember, if you want to deploy to a genymotion device, your computer will treat it as an actual connect machine. So instead of running</p>
        {% highlight bash %}
        $ ionic emulate android
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>Use <code>run</code> instead.</p>
        {% highlight bash %}
        $ ionic run android
      {% endhighlight %}

<!-- Unreleased node
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="cli-commands">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#cli-commands">Unreleased Node Versions</a></h3>

  <p>If you’re a node developer, you’re probably using the latest and greatest release of node on your system. While this is great for testing apps with node, Cordova and Ionic need to have some stability. When doing anything with the command line and Ionic, always use a stable release of node.</p>

</section>



<!-- ios emulator
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="ios-emulate">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#ios-emulate">Starting the iOS Simulator</a></h3>

  <p>Starting an iOS emulator from the command line is a really powerful feature. It gets rid of the need to open up Xcode and keeps a nice terminal-only workflow. But when you try to use <code>ionic emulate ios</code> it throws an awful error.</p>
      {% highlight bash %}Error: ios-sim was not found. Please download, build and install version 1.7 or greater from https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim into your path. Or 'npm install -g ios-sim'; using node.js: http://nodejs.org/
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>Well this is because you need to install a utility package called ios-sim. This package allows you to access the iOS simulator from the command line. This can be installed with a simple <code>npm install</code>.</p>
      {% highlight bash %}$ sudo npm install -g ios-sim
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>With this installed, you’ll be able to emulate to the iOS-simulator.</p>

<!-- missing plugins
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="plugins">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#plugins">Missing Plugins</a></h3>

  <p>When you update an iOS project to a new version of Cordova, sometimes you will get an error saying it was unable to locate a plugin. You open up Xcode, try to run and build from there and get this error in your console</p>

  {% highlight bash %}
  2014-11-12 14:36:18.284 Tell The DJ[14955:c07] ERROR: Plugin 'Device' not found, or is not a CDVPlugin. Check your plugin mapping in config.xml.
2013-08-23 14:36:18.284 Tell The DJ[14955:c07] -[CDVCommandQueue executePending] [Line 116] FAILED pluginJSON = [
  "Device1096677259",
  "Device",
  "getDeviceInfo",
  [

  ]
]
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>This can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common is manually adding files to the native project. The linking process during a build cycle gets broken and none of the native files are moved over. To fix this, delete the <code>ios.json</code> file in the plugins folder. This will make Cordova have to recopy all the plugin files.</p>
        <p>In more extreme cases, sometimes a complete removal of the project is needed.</p>

<!-- Cordova Directory
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="cordova-directory">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#cordova-directory">Cordova Directory</a></h3>
   <p>This one is pretty extreme and can cause a lot of frustration. You try to use any of the Cordova/Ionic commands and get this error.</p>
        {% highlight bash %}
          Current Working Directory is not Cordova-based project
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>At this point you’re unable to do anything further with your project. So why does this happen? Various reason, but mostly something gets corrupted with your environment configuration. You can see a <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/2213#issuecomment-55912785">thread</a> where this happened for one particular user.</p>
        <p>For his case, the solution was to run</p>
        {% highlight bash %}
          $ cordova create .
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>Basically a hidden folder that should be there wasn’t. Running that command above fixes that issue.</p>

<!-- cordova updates
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="cordova-updates">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#cordova-updates">Cordova Updates</a></h3>
  <p>When Cordova pushes a new version, it’s always best to update. So you run this command to update the Cordova binaries.</p>
        {% highlight bash %}$ sudo npm update -g cordova
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>Great, but when you try to do anything in a project, you’ll get an error. Well this is because there are actually different versions of Cordova for each platform. So from inside your project you need to run Cordova’s update command.</p>
        {% highlight bash %}
        $ cordova platform update ios
$ cordova platform update android
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>Now all your platform specific versions of Cordova are updated.</p>

<!-- Windows and git
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="windows">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#windows">Windows and Git</a></h3>
  <p>So you found this awesome plugin on github that you want to use for your app. So lets try to install it.</p>
        {% highlight bash %}
          ionic plugin add http://github.com/user/awesome-plugin
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>But then another error comes up. Whats going on? So something that Cordova doesn’t mention is that you need to have git setup for installing plugins from Github. Something like this can easily be overlooked, but thankfully it’s as easy to fix. Just visit <a href="http://git-scm.com/">the git website</a>, install and set up git, and you’re good to go.</p>

<!-- Missing Hooks
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="hooks">

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#hool=ks">Missing Cordova Hooks</a></h3>
  <p>If your project was created with an older version of the Ionic CLI, you may have come across this. You start to build as</p>
        {% highlight bash %}
          addCliHookDirectory fs.chmodSync: Error: ENOENT, no such file or directory 'hooks/after_prepare/010_add_platform_class.js'
{% endhighlight %}
<p> Thankfully this has been fixed in the latest version of the Ionic CLI. If the hook isn't found when you try to build either iOS or Android, the Ionic CLI will add it back.</p>

  <h3 class="title"><a href="#hool=ks">Incorrect Hook Permissions</a></h3>
  <p>If, instead, you see an error like this (as described in this <a href="https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/how-to-fix-this-error-spawn-eacces/20490">Ionic Forum</a> post):</p>
  {% highlight bash %}
  cordova emulate ios
  running cordova emulate ios
  Running command: /Users/username/myApp/hooks/after_prepare/010_add_platform_class.js /Users/username/myApp
  Error: spawn EACCES
  {% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    You should run
  </p>
  {% highlight bash %}
  chmod -R +x hooks/after_prepare
  {% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    This problem has been fixed in a recent version of the Ionic CLI but only helps new projects.
