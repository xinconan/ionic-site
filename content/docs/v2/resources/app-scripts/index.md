title: Ionic 2 Resources | App Build Scripts
---

Ionic apps utilize TypeScript and Sass code. This code needs to be converted into web browser friendly code. A build process is required to achieve this.
`@ionic/app-scripts` are a set of configurable scripts provided to make it easy to create a simple or a highly customized build process.

### How does it work?
Ionic app’s are developed typically using the `ionic serve` and `ionic run` commands. Both of these commands need to compile the application’s code and combine it into one bundled file.

When `ionic serve` or `ionic run` are invoked, it ultimately calls an [NPM script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). These npm scripts call the `@ionic/app-scripts` library to execute the build process.

### Why App Scripts?
Most application’s share a similar build process. Rather than have each user create their own build process from scratch for their app, we thought that time would be better spent building out their Ionic app and leaving the details to us. This is our interpretation of what most users need from a build process.

### What About Gulp?
Historically Ionic apps have used [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as tool to facilitate the build process. Over the years, `gulp` has seen less and less development, and has started to accumulate deprecation warnings. By taking advantage of standard and dependency free NPM scripts, we are reducing dependencies and simplifying the development experience.

Note: Developers are free to still use gulp if they choose to do so. We think NPM scripts are a better approach, but there is nothing in place restricting the use of gulp if that is the preferred method.

### What Scripts are Provided?

`@ionic/app-scripts` provides the following scripts:

- [build](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/build.ts) : `build` calls a set of `@ionic/app-scripts` to compile the `Typescript` source, compile `sass`, create a bundle `javascript` file, etc.

- [bundle](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/bundle.ts) : `bundle` uses [Rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/?version=0.36.1) to produce a single, high performance `javascript` file from the many smaller `javascript` files.

- [clean](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/clean.ts) : `clean` deletes any of the files generated by the `build` process. Basically, it deletes the `www` directory.

- [cleancss](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/cleancss.ts) : `cleancss` uses [CleanCSS](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css) to minify `css` to it’s smallest, fastest form.

- [closure](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/closure.ts) : `closure` uses [Google’s Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) to minify `javascript` to it’s smallest, fastest form.

- [copy](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/copy.ts) : `copy` copies files where they need to go to end up in the built `www` directory.

- [lint](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/lint.ts) : `lint` runs [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) against the `Typescript` source code. Requires a `tslint.json` file at the project root.

- [minify](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/minify.ts) : `minify` calls the minification tasks for `javascript` (uglify, or closure if available) and `css` (cleancss).

- [ngc](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/ngc.ts) : `ngc` calls the [Angular Ahead-of-time compiler](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html) to create extremely fast apps.

- [sass](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/sass.ts) : `sass` walks the application’s directory tree to find `scss` files and assemble them into one `css` file.

- [template](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/template.ts) : `template` is used to convert Angular templates into `inline-templates` for faster loading and faster applications during the development process.

- [transpile](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/transpile.ts) : `transpile` converts `Typescript` code into `javascript` code.

- [tsc](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/tsc.ts) : `tsc` calls the `Typescript` compiler.

- [uglifyjs](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/uglifyjs.ts) : `uglifyjs` is used to minify `javascript` to it’s smallest and fastest form.

- [watch](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/watch.ts) : `watch` creates a smaller, faster `build` process to be used during application development.


### Providing Custom Build Configuration

The default configured provided by `@ionic/app-scripts` covers many of the scenarios required by developers. However, if a developer wants to customize and configure the way the build process is run, they can do so.

The easiest way to configure `@ionic/app-scripts` is to take advantage of the [config](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#per-package-config-settings) option in the `package.json` file.


To get started, add a `config` entry to the `package.json` file. From there, developers can provide their own configuration file for things like `minification` (closure compiler, uglify2), and `bundling` (rollup).

See an example of specifying a custom configuration file below:

```json
  "config": {
    ...
    "ionic_rollup": "./config/rollup.config.js",
    "ionic_cleancss": "./config/cleancss.config.js",
    ...
  },
```

In the above example, custom configurations for `rollup` and `cleancss` are provided by a path to a config file.

The following `config` values are used to map to a task’s config file.

| Config File      | NPM Config Property |
|------------------|---------------------|
| CleanCss         | `ionic_cleancss`    |
| Closure Compiler | `ionic_closure`     |
| Copy             | `ionic_copy`        |
| NGC              | `ionic_ngc`         |
| Rollup           | `ionic_rollup`      |
| Sass             | `ionic_sass`        |
| TSLint           | `ionic_tslint`      |
| UglifyJS         | `ionic_uglifyjs`    |

The [default configurations](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/tree/master/config) are great examples to learn about customization options.

Note: [Command line flags](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts#command-line-flags) can also be used to provide custom configuration.

### Custom Project Structure
In most cases, the default project structure provided by Ionic works great! However, if a developer chooses to modify the structure to suit their use case, they are welcome to do so.

Using the same concepts outlined above for providing configuration using the `package.json` `config` option, developers can specify their own custom project structure.


| Config Values   | NPM Config Property | Defaults        |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| root directory  | `ionic_root_dir`    | `process.cwd()` |
| tmp directory   | `ionic_tmp_dir`     | `.tmp`          |
| src directory   | `ionic_src_dir`     | `src`           |
| www directory   | `ionic_www_dir`     | `www`           |
| build directory | `ionic_build_dir`   | `build`         |


### Ionic Environment Variable

An environment variable, `IONIC_ENV` is available in the build process to help determining whether a build is a `development` build, or a `production` build. The environment variable can be accessed like this:

```javascript
if (process.env.IONIC_ENV === 'prod') {
  console.log('we got a production buildp');
} else {
  console.log('we got a development build');
}
```

### Task Details

### Bundle

Ionic uses a tool called [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/?version=0.36.1) to combine multiple `javascript` files into one combined file. This process is often called bundling code for deployment.

#### Third Party Modules Export Errors
When using third party libraries in your code, sometimes Rollup needs additional information about the structure of the library code. Most of the time everything “Just Works”. In rare cases, libraries get too clever in how they’re `exporting` data, so we need to to tell Rollup what is being exported. This process is called providing a [namedExport](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs#custom-named-exports).

If you have an error message that looks something like this, continue on.

```
bundle failed:  Module myApp/node_modules/js-extend/extend.js does not export extend (imported by myApp/node_modules/pouchdb/lib/index-browser.es.js)
```

The best way to do this is to follow the steps above to create a custom rollup config file. To get started with that, open the project’s `package.json` file. If it doesn’t already exist, create a node at the root level for `config`, and then add a key for `ionic_rollup` as follows

```json
"config": {
  "ionic_rollup": "./scripts/rollup.config.js"
}
```

The custom rollup config file will live in a `scripts` folder at the root of the Ionic app. The file will be called `rollup.config.js` in this example.

The easiest way to fill out the Rollup config is to start with the existing Rollup config. Open `node_modules/@ionic/app-scripts/config/rollup.config.js` and copy and paste the file content into `scripts/rollup.config.js`.


Now that the config file is in good shape, let’s fix the error from above. In this example, we tried to install the super cool library [pouchdb](https://pouchdb.com/). In our error message, we can see that `pouchdb`’s `lib/index-browser.es.js` file is trying to import `extend` from the library `js-extend`, resulting in an error.

This error basically says that Rollup does not think that `js-extend` exports anything called `extend`. The solution to the problem is we need to tell Rollup that `js-extend` does in fact export `extend`.

Here is the default set of Rollup plugins

```javascript
plugins: [
  builtins(),
  commonjs(),
  nodeResolve({
      ...
  }),
  globals(),
  json()
]
```

In the Rollup config, we want to look for the `commonjs` plugin, and add an entry to the `namedExports` field.

```javascript
commonjs({
  namedExports: {
    // pouchdb
    'node_modules/js-extend/extend.js': ['extend']
}),
```

Let’s break down the `namedExport` further.

Our original error message looked like this

```
bundle failed:  Module myApp/node_modules/js-extend/extend.js does not export extend (imported by myApp/node_modules/pouchdb/lib/index-browser.es.js)
```

The error message has a reference to `myApp/node_modules/js-extend/extend.js`. It also has a reference to an export called `extend`.

In the `namedExport` entry, we can leave off `myApp`, but include the rest of the path as the entry’s key. The entry’s value is then an array of strings, in this case a lone entry of `extend`.

Providing the `namedExports` will resolve any third party library issues the vast majority of time.

#### Strict Mode
Ionic Apps (and any app that utilizes modern javascript) are written in something called `strict mode` by default. Most of the time, developers don’t need to be concerned with this. If a third party library is written without `strict mode` support, disabling `strict mode` in the Rollup config can be done. One popular library that requires `strictMode` to be `false` is [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

#### Script Tag Include
If all else fails and a library simply cannot be bundled, it can always be included in an app via an HTML `<script>` tag. This is how libraries were managed for the past twenty years, and it still works very well.

To access the library from an Ionic `Page` or `Component`, make a `declare` statement and create a variable. See an example below with jQuery.

```
declare const jQuery:any;
```

When `jQuery` is included in a web browser, it can be accessed from `window.jQuery`. In the above example, we’re mapping `jQuery` to the `window.jQuery` object. From here, `jQuery` can be used through the `Typescript` code without issue.
