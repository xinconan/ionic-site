## Description

The `ionic info` command prints out useful information about your system's Ionic environment and dependencies. This includes things such as your Ionic, Cordova, Node, and Xcode version. If submitting an issue on [Github](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2/issues), pasting the output of this command can help others diagnose the issue more quickly.
