## Description

The `build` command builds an app for a specific platform. Pass in either `ios` or `android` to generate platform specific code in the `platforms` subdirectory. The build command is a proxy for Cordova's [build command](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html#link-5).
