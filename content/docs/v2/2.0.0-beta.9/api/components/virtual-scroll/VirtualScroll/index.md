<p>Virtual Scroll displays a virtual, &quot;infinite&quot; list. An array of records
is passed to the virtual scroll containing the data to create templates
for. The template created for each record, referred to as a cell, can
consist of items, headers, and footers.</p>
<p>For performance reasons, not every record in the list is rendered at once;
instead a small subset of records (enough to fill the viewport) are rendered
and reused as the user scrolls.</p>
<h3 id="the-basics">The Basics</h3>
<p>The array of records should be passed to the <code>virtualScroll</code> property.
The data given to the <code>virtualScroll</code> property must be an array. An item
template with the <code>*virtualItem</code> property is required in the <code>virtualScroll</code>.
The <code>virtualScroll</code> and <code>*virtualItem</code> properties can be added to any element.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;ion-list [virtualScroll]=&quot;items&quot;&gt;

  &lt;ion-item *virtualItem=&quot;let item&quot;&gt;
    {% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;

&lt;/ion-list&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="section-headers-and-footers">Section Headers and Footers</h3>
<p>Section headers and footers are optional. They can be dynamically created
from developer-defined functions. For example, a large list of contacts
usually has a divider for each letter in the alphabet. Developers provide
their own custom function to be called on each record. The logic in the
custom function should determine whether to create the section template
and what data to provide to the template. The custom function should
return <code>null</code> if a template shouldn&#39;t be created.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;ion-list [virtualScroll]=&quot;items&quot; [headerFn]=&quot;myHeaderFn&quot;&gt;

  &lt;ion-item-divider *virtualHeader=&quot;let header&quot;&gt;
    Header: {% raw %}{{ header }}{% endraw %}
  &lt;/ion-item-divider&gt;

  &lt;ion-item *virtualItem=&quot;let item&quot;&gt;
    Item: {% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;

&lt;/ion-list&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Below is an example of a custom function called on every record. It
gets passed the individual record, the record&#39;s index number,
and the entire array of records. In this example, after every 20
records a header will be inserted. So between the 19th and 20th records,
between the 39th and 40th, and so on, a <code>&lt;ion-item-divider&gt;</code> will
be created and the template&#39;s data will come from the function&#39;s
returned data.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ts">myHeaderFn(record, recordIndex, records) {
  if (recordIndex % 20 === 0) {
    return &#39;Header &#39; + recordIndex;
  }
  return null;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="approximate-widths-and-heights">Approximate Widths and Heights</h3>
<p>The approximate width and height of each template is used to help
determine how many cells should be created, and to help calculate
the height of the scrollable area. Note that the actual rendered size
of each cell comes from the app&#39;s CSS, whereas this approximation
is only used to help calculate initial dimensions.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also important to know that Ionic&#39;s default item sizes have
slightly different heights between platforms, which is perfectly fine.
An exact pixel-perfect size is not necessary, but a good estimation
is important. Basically if each item is roughly 500px tall, rather than
the default of 40px tall, it&#39;s extremely important to know for virtual
scroll to calculate a good height.</p>
<h3 id="images-within-virtual-scroll">Images Within Virtual Scroll</h3>
<p>Ionic provides <code>&lt;ion-img&gt;</code> to manage HTTP requests and image rendering.
Additionally, it includes a customizable placeholder element which shows
before the image has finished loading. While scrolling through items
quickly, <code>&lt;ion-img&gt;</code> knows not to make any image requests, and only loads
the images that are viewable after scrolling. It&#39;s also important for app
developers to ensure image sizes are locked in, and after images have fully
loaded they do not change size and affect any other element sizes.</p>
<p>We recommend using our <code>&lt;ion-img&gt;</code> element over the native <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element
because when an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is added to the DOM, it immediately
makes a HTTP request for the image file. HTTP requests, image
decoding, and image rendering can cause issues while scrolling. For virtual
scrolling, the natural effects of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> are not desirable features.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;ion-list [virtualScroll]=&quot;items&quot;&gt;

  &lt;ion-item *virtualItem=&quot;let item&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ion-avatar item-left&gt;
      &lt;ion-img [src]=&quot;item.avatarUrl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ion-img&gt;
    &lt;/ion-avatar&gt;
   {% raw %} {{ item.firstName }} {{ item.lastName }}{% endraw %}
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;

&lt;/ion-list&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="performance-tips">Performance Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>&lt;ion-img&gt;</code> rather than <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> so images are lazy loaded
while scrolling.</li>
<li>Image sizes should be locked in, meaning the size of any element
should not change after the image has loaded.</li>
<li>Provide an approximate width and height so the virtual scroll can
best calculate the cell height.</li>
<li>Changing the dataset requires the entire virtual scroll to be
reset, which is an expensive operation and should be avoided
if possible.</li>
<li>Do not perform any DOM manipulation within section header and
footer functions. These functions are called for every record in the
dataset, so please make sure they&#39;re performant.</li>

with a buffer ratio of <code>2</code> it will create <code>40</code> cells that are
available for reuse while scrolling. For better performance, it&#39;s
better to have more cells than what are required to fill the
viewable area. Default is <code>2</code>.</p>
