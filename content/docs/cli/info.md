# Gathering information about your runtime

If you ever need to find out your system environment runtime information in a quick way, we provide the `ionic info` command. If you ever need to report an error, please specify this information.

If you are on a Mac, this should provide you information like the following:

```bash
$ ionic info

Your system information:

OS: Mac OS X Yosemite
Node Version: v0.10.33
Cordova CLI: 4.1.2
Ionic CLI Version: 1.3.2
Xcode version: Xcode 6.1.1 Build version 6A2008a
ios-sim version: 3.1.1
```

If you have [any errors](/docs/cli/errors.html) and need to report them, we suggest providing this information to help us assist you in finding the error(s).
