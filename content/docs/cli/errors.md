# Getting help with your errors

Since everyone is running a different environment on their machines, most likely with different settings/configurations, errors are bound to occur.

We are dedicated to making Ionic Framework the best we can. There are many places to go to get help with your errors. Listed below are some places we actively monitor, as well as where your question may be best posted.

## Ionic Forums

[The Ionic Forums](http://forum.ionicframework.com/) is where most of the Ionic community comes together to share and help one another. We are very active in monitoring our forums to help users with their issues. Generally, most users here help respond to issues other users are having as well.

You can find help here with generally anything ionic related.

Ionic is an open source platform, and as such, we host all of our projects on github. There are several places you may want to look based on your problems.

Generally, we think of our projects as following.
