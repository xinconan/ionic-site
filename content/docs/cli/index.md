The Ionic Framework command line utility makes it easy to start, build, run, and emulate Ionic apps. In the future, it will also have support for our mobile development services and tools that make Ionic even more powerful.

Enter either `ionic --help` or `ionic help` command(s) for more detailed task information.

Alternatively, just type `ionic help` in the terminal to receive additional help.

### What is a command line utility?

A command line utility is one to be used from a shell (or commonly known as a Terminal). It receives input from this shell, and reports its output in the same shell.

If you are on a mac, look for `Terminal`. If you're on a Windows machine, look for `Command Prompt`.

Once you're in the terminal or command prompt, [install the Ionic CLI tools](/docs/cli/install.html).
