# Using Sass

By default, starter projects are hooked up to Ionic's precompiled CSS file, which is found in the project's `www/lib/ionic/css` directory, and is linked to the app in the head of the root `index.html` file. However, Ionic projects can also be customized using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), which gives developers and designers "superpowers" in terms of creating and maintaining CSS. Below are two ways to setup Sass for your Ionic project (the `ionic setup sass` command simply does the manual steps for you). Once Sass has been setup for your Ionic project, then the `ionic serve` command will also watch for Sass changes.

#### Setup Sass Automatically

```bash
$ ionic setup sass
```

You can start to write your sass in your `./scss/ionic.app.scss` file.
If you need any more help working with sass, we have a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_frPHsE2PZk) that covers the basics.


#### Setup Sass Manually

1. Run `npm install` from the working directory of an Ionic project. This will install [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) and a few handy tasks, such as [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-sass) and [gulp-minify-css](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-minify-css).
2. Remove `<link href="lib/ionic/css/ionic.css" rel="stylesheet">` from the `<head>` of the root `index.html` file.
3. Remove `<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">` from the `<head>` of the root `index.html` file.
4. Add `<link href="css/ionic.app.css" rel="stylesheet">` to the `<head>` of the root `index.html` file.
5. In the `ionic.project` file, add the JavaScript property `"gulpStartupTasks": ["sass", "watch"]` (this can also be customized to whatever gulp tasks you'd like).
