# Getting help with your errors

Since everyone is running a different environment on their machines, most likely with different settings/configurations, errors are bound to occur.

We are dedicated to making Ionic Framework the best we can. There are many places to go to get help with your errors. Listed below are some places we actively monitor, as well as where your question may be best posted.

The main channels we listen into are [our twitter](http://twitter.com/ionicframework), [the ionic forums](http://forum.ionicframework.com/), and our [github repositories](http://github.com/driftyco).

We humbly ask that if you post to the forums or any github repository issues that you also specify [your user environment](/docs/cli/info) by running `ionic info` in your command line to provide us with your system runtime information.

However, depending on your issue, it may be easier to get a few heads up on where to go when something goes wrong.

## Ionic Forums

[The Ionic Forums](http://forum.ionicframework.com/) is where most of the Ionic community comes together to share and help one another. We are very active in monitoring our forums to help users with their issues. Generally, most users here help respond to issues other users are having as well.

You can find help here with anything ionic related.
