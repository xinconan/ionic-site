# Welcome to Ionic

We designed Ionic to help web developers build great mobile apps and Progressive Web Apps in a way that felt just like building websites. That means we focus on taking the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you'd use to build a website, and help you turn it into mobile magic. These technologies have served developers well for the last twenty years, and we think that makes them a pretty great bet for the next twenty.

Many developers will find that their Ionic apps can be built almost entirely with a standard web browser and any old computer. And once you're ready to grab data from a sensor or use a new device feature like TouchID, native mobile features are just an install away. We think that's pretty neat.

We're proud to say that Ionic has been used by millions of developers to build millions of apps in more countries than we will ever visit in our lifetimes. Over those two years, we've been listening to your feedback on how to build a better way to build better apps and we're excited to finally take the wraps off the best Ionic yet.

Ionic 2 represents that collective learning about how to make the web do more on mobile. We've overhauled nearly every part, from the way that users navigate through app pages, to how apps work across native and web environments, to how we help you wield the true powers of the underlying native SDKs and device features.

We hope you find that Ionic 2 not only makes app development easier and faster, but more *fun*. Because mobile technology is all about finding new ways to change the way humans interact with the world, and we can't think of anything more fun than that.

To get started with the next generation of Ionic, please head over to the [installation](installation) guide to get your computer set up to build amazing mobile apps with the web.
